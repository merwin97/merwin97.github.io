Over the summer of 2023, I became interested in radio controlled (RC) vehicles. Primarily, I was interested in first person view (FPV) quadcopters. In FPV, the setup consists of a vehicle, in this case a quadcopter drone, with a camera
on board. This camera transmits video to the operator who is wearing a set of goggles that display the video feed. This allows for an immersive epxerience. I had heard about head tracking in my research into FPV. This is a
technology that uses the goggles to track the head movement of the operater to move the camera on the vehicle. I thought that this would be a cool thing to try out in my RC car, to simulate being in the car. Unfortunately,
the equipment required to do this is rather expensive, so I decided to try to build my own. I figured it wouldn't be too hard since I already had some of the parts I'd need. 

The hardware that needed to be on the vehicle is fairly simple.
