This project is my final project for MEGN201 (Introduction to Mechanical Engineering: Design & Fabrication). This was a group project that I did with two other people. Together, we had to design and 
fabricate a derby car. 

##### Requirements

* Between 3 and 5 inches wide (in order to fit on the track)
* No more than 6.25 inches long
* Between 250 and 650 grams
* Bushings that press fit into the chassis
* A spoiler that protrudes at least 1 inch above the top of the car
* An acrylic skid plate on the bottom of the car
* Must only use given materials (no adhesives or lubricants) 

##### Design

The design we settled on is an I-beam style design with a small slope on the front. We chose this design for its ease of manufacture. We also included the large cut outs to save weight.
